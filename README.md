# Villa Availability & Pricing System

This repository contains a full-stack implementation of a **Villa Availability & Pricing** system.

The project is split into two independent applications:

- **Backend**: Node.js + Express API for villa availability and pricing
- **Frontend**: Flutter (mobile-first, web demo) consuming the backend APIs

Each application has its own README with detailed setup and usage instructions.
